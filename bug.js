This error occurs when using the `useCallback` hook in React Native with a function that uses the `useState` hook internally.  The issue is that `useCallback` memoizes the function, but it doesn't memoize the closure. This means that if the state within the function changes on every render, the memoized function will always be considered different, defeating the purpose of `useCallback`. This leads to unnecessary re-renders and performance issues.  

Example:
```javascript
import React, { useState, useCallback } from 'react';

function MyComponent() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  const memoizedIncrement = useCallback(() => {
    setCount(count + 1);
  }, [count]); //Incorrect dependency array

  return (
    <View>
      <Text>{count}</Text>
      <Button title="Increment" onPress={memoizedIncrement} />
    </View>
  );
}
```
