The solution is to include `setCount` in the dependency array of `useCallback`.  However, this can lead to infinite loops because any change in `count` leads to a new function which triggers re-renders.   A better approach is to avoid direct state updates within the callback by creating an additional wrapper function. 

```javascript
import React, { useState, useCallback } from 'react';

function MyComponent() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  const incrementCount = useCallback(() => {
    setCount(prevCount => prevCount + 1);
  }, []); // Empty dependency array

  const memoizedIncrement = useCallback(() => {
    incrementCount();
  }, [incrementCount]); // Correct dependency array

  return (
    <View>
      <Text>{count}</Text>
      <Button title="Increment" onPress={memoizedIncrement} />
    </View>
  );
}
```
By using the functional update `setCount(prevCount => prevCount + 1)`, we remove `count` from the dependency array.  Then, by creating a new callback `incrementCount` and only using it within `memoizedIncrement` we are able to leverage memoization efficiently and prevent issues from arising.
